# infographics-exploration

This Repo contains 2 ways of drawing infographics and generate an image.

1. Using React-Flow library, we create a React UI which displays generated image on browser; and later should provide functionality of downloading it.
2. Pillow library from python. It will create .jpg and will store it on file system.
